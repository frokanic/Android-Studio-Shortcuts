# Android-Studio-Shortcuts

This text document will be my personal reference guide to android studio shortcuts. Instead of collecting them all at once, and ending up never using them, I will be adding them little by little, grokking work, and then proceeding to add more. For the time being I am working on a linux as well as on a windows machine, so macos shortcuts will not be included. This may (or may not) change in the future
