# Android-Studio-Shortcuts

This text document will be my personal reference guide to android studio shortcuts. Instead of collecting them all at once, and ending up never using them, I will be adding them little by little, grokking work, and then proceeding to add more. For the time being I am working on a linux as well as on a windows machine, so macos shortcuts will not be included. This may (or may not) change in the future

## Shortcuts

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Shortcut Key</th>
    <th>Description</th>

  <tr>
    <td><code>Ctrl + Shift + V</code></td>
    <td>Paste from recent clipboard history</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>Ctrl + D</code></td>
    <td>Duplicate the current line or selection</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>Ctrl + W</code></td>
    <td>Incrementally selects a larger block of code. Starts from the word where the cursor is located and expands the selection to include enclosing expressions or code blocks.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
