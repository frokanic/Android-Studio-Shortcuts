# Android-Studio-Shortcuts

This text document will be my personal reference guide to android studio shortcuts. Instead of collecting them all at once, and ending up never using them, I will be adding them little by little, grokking work, and then proceeding to add more. For the time being I am working on a linux as well as on a windows machine, so macos shortcuts will not be included. This may (or may not) change in the future

## Shortcuts

| Shortcut Key                     | Description                                                |
|:---------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `Ctrl + Shift + V`               | Paste from recent clipboard history                        |
| `Ctrl + D`             | Duplicate the current line or selection       |
| `Ctrl + W`   | Incrementally selects a larger block of code. Starts from the word where the cursor is located and expands the selection to include enclosing expressions or code blocks. |
