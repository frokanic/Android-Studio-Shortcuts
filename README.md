# Android-Studio-Shortcuts

This text document will be my personal reference guide to android studio shortcuts. Instead of collecting them all at once, and ending up never using them, I will be adding them little by little, grokking work, and then proceeding to add more. For the time being I am working on a linux as well as on a windows machine, so macos shortcuts will not be included. This may (or may not) change in the future

## Shortcuts

| Shortcut Key                     | Description                                                |
|:---------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Ctrl + Shift + V               | Paste from recent clipboard history                        |
| Ctrl + D             | Duplicate the current line or selection       |
| Ctrl + W   | Incrementally selects a larger block of code. Starts from the word where the cursor is located and expands the selection to include enclosing expressions or code blocks. |
| Ctrl + Shift + W | Decreases the current selection, reversing the effect of Ctrl + W by progressively shrinking the selected code block. |
| Ctrl + Shift + Backspace   | Takes you back to the last place you edited in your code. |
| Ctrl + Shift + ↑ / ↓           | Move the current line up or down in the code                |
| Ctrl + P | Shows the parameter info for the method or function you're currently typing, displaying the expected arguments and their types. |
